TROUBLESHOOTING (Mini-FAQ)
--------------------------

Q: TNT won't compile on my system.
A: Be sure that you did the right steps like descriped in "README".
   If this doesn't help, please mail the errors your compiler produce to
   > tnt-bugs@excelsior.kullen.rwth-aachen.de
   (You can log this with "make 2> problem-log")
   We worked hard to get a clean version which work on all systems. But we
   had a lot of trouble with glibc2 based systems and different linux-
   distributions. Maybe there are problems left, so inform us, even if you
   can fix the problem by yourself.
   This version was tested on:
   -Linux 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, with libc5-, glibc2.0 and glibc2.1 based
    systems. (Tested distributions: SuSE 5.2, 5.3, 6.0. Redhat 5.2, Debian
    Potato).
   -NetBSD
   -Solaris (had some trouble with the snprintf()-function, which is only part
             of GNU-libc. Please tell us if you encounter a problem).
   -DEC Alpha? (not sure about this, but think it works well ;-), since Berndt
                has adapted TNT to 64-bit)

Q: I start TNT, but nothing happens, I just come back to the shell-prompt
A: Maybe you are using the ax25k-version of TNT, and have no ax25-daemon
   running. Or your axconfig is wrong.
   You will find a message like this in your tnterr.log:
   > axconfig: unable to open axports file
   > tnt: no AX.25 port data configured

Q: I try to start TNT, but gets a message that "tnt.ini" is in wrong
   format.
A: Maybe you updated from an old version, and don't updated tnt.ini.
   A lot has changed in this version, so take a look at the examples-files.

Q: Password generation does not longer work with RMNC/Flexnet
A: With version 3.3h of RMNC/Flexnet you must use "THENET" generation
   instead of "FLEXNET", so use the line
   "FLXNOD THENET flxnod.pw 6 sys" in your pw.tnt file
   (Thanks to f5ibh)

Q: I do not like TNT installing completly over the filesystem
A: TNT uses standard UNIX-filelocations in newer release. But you can use
   some tricks to do anything you like:
   a) If you like TNTs files in /usr/local/, but do not like the variable
      files in /var, you can use
      ./configure --localstatedir=/usr/local/var [--other-options...]
      to use /usr/local/var instead of /var
   b) If you want to install TNT for one user in your homedirectory use
      ./configure --prefix=~/tnt --localstatedir=~/tnt [--other...]
      (make sure that "~/tnt/" exists)
   c) If you really like the old behavior (one directory /usr/local/tnt with
      all files in it), you have to change "configure.in".
      Look at the target *-*-linux* (or the target for your system) and
      change all the definitions for tnt_xyz_dir (for example write
      "tnt_main_dir=/usr/local/tnt").
      After this you HAVE to call "autoconf" (make sure that autotools
      are installed on your system) and then "./configure", "make" and
      "make install".
    d) NEW:
       Because of the many requests TNT now has a flat option in configure.
       If you liked the old behavior (installing TNT completly under
				      /usr/local/tnt), just use this flags:
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-flat [--other...]
       The "flat" option installs TNT completly under "$prefix/tnt/".
  
Q: I don't hear any sounds, but I configured TNT with --enable-sound
A: There are several possibilites.
   First check if you soft-enabled the soundeffects, with ":SOUND ON"
   Check if your "sound.tnt" is in the right place, there will be no
   error-message if TNT cannot find this file.
   Take a look in your tnterr.log, maybe your sounddevice is busy, a sound-
   file isn't found or the sound-player script is defect.
   Are you sure that your soundcard works properly? Test it out with
   "cat soundfile.au > /dev/audio", were soundfile.au should be a sun-audio
   file. Or use some textfile, which should make some noisy sound ;-)

Q: AX25 does not work, any connection coming from outside is disconnect at
   once.
A: Unfortunately the ax25 transmiter is still broken on several systems :-(
   Maybe it is a good idea, to use tfkiss (with ax25 or net2kiss) instead.
   (It may take some time, until ax25 works)
   Please read the file "AX25-NOTES"
 
Q: A remotestation send me a remote-command, but nothing happend.
A: If there isn't any error-message, TNT maybe think that the remote station
   is a node, digi or box. TNT would not allow any remotecommand coming from
   such a station (except of //COMP).
   Check the stationsname in the statusline and look at "routes.tnt", if
   you find a "N>DB0XYZ" or "B>DB0XYZ" there, then TNT don't allow the command.
   Maybe TNT doesn't notice that there isn't a connect to node, digi or box
   any longer (I know that TheNet sometimes don't send a proper reconnected-
   message). You can update the remotestation call with the ":CONC <call>"
   command.

Q: Remotestation cannot start any run-command.
A: Be sure that you set the rights in "tnt.ini" properly. Each runprogramm
   must run as a single-task on your UNIX-system, so must get specific
   user and group-rights.
   You can tell TNT which rights should be used in "tnt.ini". You have to
   possibilites:
   1) Each runprogram will run as a special user you create for your system,
      eg. "prrun".
   2) Each runprogram will run in a special group class, eg. "prrun". TNT
      then will create new users (dependent on the callsign).
   In most cases you should prefer the first possibility. Take a look at
   the example "tnt.ini" file.

Q: MD2 password generation does not work any longer
A: The promptstring is not longer hardcoded, so you must define your
   string in the pw.tnt (usually "MD2"). Take a look in the sample pw.tnt

Q: I would like to use MD5 password generation
A: No problem. MD5 is implemented in the current version. Just use MD5
   instead of MD2 in the pw.tnt (see example)
   
Q: Newuser generation does not work, TNT even won't start.
A: It is unsecure to use this function, so it was disabled by default.
   You really should use a special user to run the runprograms.
   If you still want to use unix_new_user, you must reconfigure and recompile
   TNT with --enable-genuser.
   If TNT won't start, because you still have definitions for "unix_new_user"
   etc. you should comment out this lines, take a look at tnt.ini in
   examples dir.
   (BTW: If you really want use unix_new_user you should define maximum user-
         ID TNT would use to create new users. use key "unix_user_max" for
	 this, as you found in examples/tnt.ini)

Q: Run-program terminates, though it doesn't seem to be finished.
A: Look in your tnterr.log. All errormessages child-tasks of TNT produce
   will be logged there.

Q: It seems that I found a bug in TNT.
A: Please report this to our mailinglist at
      tnt-bugs@excelsior.kullen.rwth-aachen.de
   It should be useful if you can include an errorreport, and if you can
   reproduce the problem, so that we can find a solution fast, without
   too much analysing the code ;-)

Q: Where can I find new versions of TNT?
A: There are several servers which mirrors TNT.
   In most cases you find it at
   > http://www.wspse.de
   > ftp://ftp.wspse.de/pub/packet_radio/tnt
   > ftp://ftp.wspse.de
   > ftp://ftp.ping.net.au
   If you want to be informed about new versions via email, why not
   subscribe to our mailinglist.
   Just send a mail to
   > tnt-announce-request@excelsior.kullen.rwth-aachen.de
   with the single word "SUBSCRIBE" in message-content.
   (See README, and my homepage for details).

   TNT is also available via anonymous CVS (look in the README), but notice
   that CVS might not even compile.
