Originally TNT was written for use with hostmode TNCs.
Maybe you want to use the AX25 features of the Linux kernel.

Well, TNT has an ax25-interface build in, but unfortunately there are
many different systems and different axutils/axkernels.
Because of this you might encounter problems while compiling TNT with
AX25k support or running TNT with it.

If you got problems while using AX25k interface you should try to find out
why and maybe how to fix it. Unfortunately most of us use other
configurations or do not use AX25k at all.

When you really want to use AX25k you must check some things first:
-make sure that you have a linux-kernel with AX25 support
-make sure that you have installed the axutils correctly
-continue only if your ax25-subsystem works fine

To compile TNT with AX25k, just use one of the both options while
running ./configure:
--enable-ax25k
--enable-ax25k2

Use "--enable-ax25k" if you have the old axutils installed (in this case
you might have to copy the config-dir of your axutils to
"/usr/include/ax25" or other include-directory on your system).
Otherwise if you have new axutils use "--enable-ax25k2" instead.

TNT now might compile and run (after uncommenting ax25k_port in tnt.ini)
with AX25k interface, congratulations.

OK, all of this failed and it do not work.
Sorry, but you have been warned ;-)

There is another option how to use TNT with your AX25 system, and it works
100%.
All you need is the program "net2kiss" (or similar programs) from your
axutils tools and the hostmode emulator TFkiss (available from
ftp://ftp.ping.net.au and ftp://ftp.wspse.de)

First setup a pseudodevice with kissmode available by calling:
net2kiss -i <ifname> <pty-device> &
were <ifname> stands for the kernel AX25 network interface like "scc0",
"bcsf0" or any other.
were <pty-device> stands for a pseudoterminal like "/dev/ptya0"

Then start TFkiss which uses "/dev/ttya0" (or any other end of your
pseudodevice used in net2kiss) as kissdevice.

After this just start TNT with using TFkiss. This should work fine and
without any problems. CPU usage in this solution is only minor higher than
with the native AX25 interface.

net2kiss, TFkiss, TNT and DPbox is proved to use only small CPU on a P75
(just some minutes per month).
