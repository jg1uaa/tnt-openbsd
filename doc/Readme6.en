TNT has an interface to support an ax25-kernel (on linux-systems).

Options:
PORT: AX25-port
MONI: activate fullmoni-flag. If deactived (default) TNT only shows
      received frames.
      Activate if you want to see all frames (this will cause an high
      systemload, because TNT must analysise ALL frames)
